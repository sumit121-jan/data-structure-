Additionally, sets offer faster membership testing since they use hash tables, allowing you to check if an element exists in constant time ( O(1)), unlike lists, where membership testing can take linear time ( O(n)). Sets also support mathematical set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference, making them useful for tasks like finding common elements between two collections or combining them without duplicates. Another benefit is that sets are unordered, meaning they don't maintain the order of elements, which can save memory and enhance performance in situations when order isn't crucial. Because it is more effective to remove an item from a set than from a list, sets also allow for quicker element removal. Lists would be better suitable if you need to preserve the order of entries or permit duplicates, as sets do not provide indexing or ordering. Lists work better for ordered collections that could include duplicate items, whereas sets are generally preferable for operations when uniqueness and efficiency are important regardless of order.\n"

Although collisions can happen when two keys provide the same hash result, the hash function makes sure that every key is assigned to a distinct index in the array. In these situations, dispute resolution strategies like chaining or open addressing are employed. Python's built-in hash() function is used to hash the keys in hash tables, which are used to create dictionaries. since of this, dictionaries are very effective at handling key-value pairs since they enable fast lookups, insertions, and removals. A Python dictionary's keys need to be hashable and immutable in order for their hash values to stay constant.

In earlier versions, dictionaries used a hashing mechanism to store data, which meant the order of items was not predictable.
